# Absolute-Risk-Reduction
Python code for calculating Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) in an actual condition.
In this code, the calculate_arr function takes four parameters: experimental_group_events, experimental_group_total, control_group_events, and control_group_total. These parameters represent the number of events (e.g., cases of a disease) in the experimental and control groups, as well as the total number of individuals in each group.

The function calculates the rates of events in both groups by dividing the number of events by the respective total. It then subtracts the experimental group rate from the control group rate to obtain the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).

Finally, the code demonstrates an example usage by providing sample values for the variables and printing the calculated ARR.

Please note that this code assumes that you have the necessary data for the experimental and control groups. You can replace the example values with your actual data to get the correct ARR based on your specific scenario.
